# blog
This repository contains the code that powers my blog *[I'm not a nerd](imnotanerd.herokuapp.com)*.

It runs with [bloggit](http://github.com/subiabre/bloggit), a bare bones static site generator that I made specifically to power my blog.

It is deployed using Heroku's integration with GitHub.
